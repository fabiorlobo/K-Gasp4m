# What is this?

**K_Gasp4m** is a password generator. Yeah, the name looks like a password too! It means "K - Generate a strong password for me".

## How it works?

Access this link for generate awesome passwords: [**K_Gasp4m: Password Generator**](https://fabiorlobo.github.io/K_Gasp4m/)

**K_Gasp4m** generates passwords using three groups of characters:

	allcaps: ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ
	lowercase: abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz
	numbers: 23456789
	special: !?@#$%&*()-_+=<>[]{}

As you can see, some letters and numbers are missing — that's for better readability. Some times "l" and "I" looks exactly the same, right?!

## Advanced options

Oh, do you want to use the code on your project? No problem! All the magic is on this file: `assets/dev_files/scripts/password-generator.js`.

Need to customize the CSS or even the JS? Using Gulp, edit the files on `assets/dev_files` folder!

### Gulp tasks

	gulp
	
Generates CSS with Compass and JS with Uglify.

	gulp watch

See `gulpfile.js` for more options.
